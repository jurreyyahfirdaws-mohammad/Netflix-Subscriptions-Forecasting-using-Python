# Netflix-Subscriptions-Forecasting-using-Python
A fundamental business strategy that helps Netflix to plan, strategize, and make data-driven decisions involves forecasting the number of subscriptions the company will obtain in a certain time frame. Their success and expansion in the very competitive streaming market are ultimately facilitated by the improvement of operational effectiveness, financial planning, and content strategy.


Netflix can estimate the anticipated number of new members in a specific time period and have a better understanding of their company's growth potential by using approaches like time series forecasting. The steps we can take to predict Netflix subscription numbers are listed below:

- Gather historical information on Netflix subscription growth
- Data preparation and cleaning
- Assess and analyze time series patterns
- Select an ARIMA or LSTM time series forecasting model. (In this project I have made the predictions using ARIMA)
- Utilize the training data to train the model.
